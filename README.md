# Crash course on Python basics / Numpy / Scipy

Based on the tutorials for Stanford courses cs228 and cs231n (forked from kuleshov/cs228-material).

You may follow the iPython notebook on github, or clone and execute it locally.
The notebook is based on an [earlier version](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) prepared by Justin Johnson.
